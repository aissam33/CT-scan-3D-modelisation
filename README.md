# CT-scan-3D-modelisation
#A detailed report on how the code functions is available in the 'Project_reports' PDF file.
This project explores 3D volumetric reconstruction methods from 2D slices obtained from a CT-Scan, with a particular focus on the Marching Cubes algorithm. An initial comparative study of different reconstruction techniques, including the Cuberille, Marching Cubes, Dual Contouring, Surface Nets, and Volume Rendering approaches, provided insights into their fundamental principles, advantages, and limitations. Following this analysis, the Marching Cubes algorithm was selected as the primary method due to its ability to generate precise and optimized 3D surface models.The next phase of the project involved implementing the Marching Cubes algorithm to construct a 3D model based on a mathematical function defining isosurfaces. This implementation was then applied to real data, specifically 2D images obtained from CT-Scans, to generate a three-dimensional model of the studied volume. The results demonstrated the capability of this method to produce accurate and exploitable 3D visualizations for medical applications while providing a robust foundation for future analysis or automated segmentation.
